# Monolog

Monolog is a personal website engine for developers who want to own their content without managing a CMS. It operates on a simple philosophy: **You shouldn't have to leave your workflow to update your website.**

If you push code to GitHub, post thoughts on Bluesky, bookmark articles on Raindrop, or upload videos to YouTube, Monolog fetches that activity and weaves it into a single, beautiful, chronological timeline.

It is "Headless" in the truest sense: You don't write content *for* Monolog. You live your digital life, and Monolog records it.

Here is a more cohesive rewrite that blends the design philosophy with the technical instructions:

### The Aesthetic & Theming

Monolog defaults to a "Paper & Ink" design philosophy: a high-contrast, single-column layout that prioritizes typography and readability. By relying exclusively on advanced CSS for filtering and interactions, the site loads instantly without any client-side JavaScript overhead.

The visual layer is completely decoupled from the build logic, living entirely within `index.liquid`. The default template uses **OKLCH** color spaces for perceptual uniformity. To customize the look, simply edit the CSS variables in the `<style>` block. System-wide Dark Mode is supported automatically via `prefers-color-scheme`, though you can override these values in the template's media query to suit your taste.

## ⚙️ Configuration (`config.json`)

The `config.json` file is the brain of your site.

### 1. Profile

This section controls the header, footer, and SEO metadata.

### 2. Analytics

Monolog supports privacy-friendly analytics out of the box.

| Provider | Property | Type | Description |

## ✍️ How to Write Content

Monolog uses GitHub Discussions as its primary authoring tool. To set this up, enable "Discussions" in your GitHub repository settings.

| Content Type | GitHub Category | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Articles** | `General` | Long-form writing. Displayed with a title and a summary. Labels become filter tags (e.g., "CSS", "Rust"). |
| **Notes** | `Notes` | Micro-blogging. No title required; the full text is shown inline. Perfect for status updates or quick thoughts. |
| **The "Now" Page** | `Announcements` | *Special:* Monolog looks for the most recent post in the `Announcements` (or `Now`) category of your `username.github.io` repo. It pins this content to the very top of your site. |
| **Drafts** | `Drafts` | Anything in here is ignored by the build engine. |

*Note: You can also pull "Notes" from Bluesky, Mastodon, or Lemmy automatically.*

## 🔌 Connecting Services

Monolog is an aggregator. You define "Sources" in your `config.json`, and the engine does the rest.

### GitHub
This is the core of Monolog. We can track multiple repositories (e.g., your personal blog repo vs. your work organization). It can pull content from discussions, issues, and tagged releases.

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `name` | `string` | **Required.** Internal ID used for generating specific RSS feeds later. |
| `owner` | `string` | **Required.** The GitHub username or Organization name. |
| `repos` | `array` | **Required.** List of repository names to fetch from. |
| `discussions` | `bool` | Default `true`. Fetch blog posts/notes. |
| `releases` | `bool` | Default `true`. Fetch releases/tags. |
| `issues` | `bool` | Default `false`. Fetch issue activity. |

**Global GitHub Options:**
| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `groups` | Map specific repositories to a "Topic" tag in the filter bar. Key is the Tag name, Value is array of `owner/repo`. |
| `tag_overrides` | Dictionary to fix tag capitalization (e.g., `{"css": "CSS"}`). Default is lowercase slug. |

```json
"github": {
  "sources": [
    {
      "name": "personal",       // Used for internal ID
      "owner": "example",   // Your username
      "repos": ["my-blog"],     // The repo where you write Discussions
      "discussions": true,
      "releases": true
    }
  ],
  // Optional: Map specific repos to a clean "Topic" tag in the UI
  "groups": {
    "Infrastructure": ["dotfiles", "server-config"]
  },
  // Optional: Fix tag capitalization (e.g. "css" -> "CSS")
  "tag_overrides": { "css": "CSS", "api": "API" }
}
```

### Bluesky

## 📡 Custom Feeds

Monolog generates RSS or Atom feeds automatically but you probably don't want your "What I'm Reading" links cluttering your "Code Release" RSS feed. Monolog lets you generate specific feeds for specific audiences.

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `type` | `string` | `"rss"` or `"atom"`. |
| `sources` | `array` | A list of **Source Names** (defined in your service configs above). Use `["*"]` to include everything. |
| `title` | `string` | (Optional) The title of the XML feed. Defaults to profile name. |
| `groups` | `array` | (Optional) Filter items further by requiring them to belong to a specific Group defined in `github.groups`. |

In `config.json`, the `feeds` block maps output files to the `name` of the sources you defined above.

```json
"feeds": {
  // The Firehose: Everything goes here
  "feed.xml": { "type": "rss", "sources": ["*"] },

  // A specific feed for just code releases and devlog
  "feeds/code.xml": {
    "type": "atom",
    "sources": ["personal", "work-code"],
    "title": "John's Engineering Log"
  },

  // A stream of just your social media posts
  "feeds/stream.xml": {
    "type": "rss",
    "sources": ["social-bluesky", "youtube-vlog"],
    "title": "John's Social Stream"
  }
}
```

## 🤖 Automatic Deployment

You don't need to manually build the site, use a GitHub Action!

To enable Github Pages, go to `Settings > Pages`, and set the Source to **GitHub Actions** then create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy Monolog

  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */4 * * *' # Updates every 4 hours
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6

        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm install
      - run: node build.js
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
          # Add other tokens here if needed
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: '.'
